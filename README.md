- I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Analytics. 

- Currently working at [Loka](https://github.com/LokaHQ), helping start-ups kickstart their business with the use of AI. 

- Before embarking on my professional journey, I delved into the research world, focusing on integrating Transformers within an encoder-decoder architecture for remote sensing image captioning. You can explore it [here](https://github.com/Jbarata98/remote-sensing-image-captioning)

- I also enjoy discussing topics within the AI field, which is why I dedicate some of my time giving lectures at Data Science workshops and bootcamps hosted by [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/).
