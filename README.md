I'm a ML Engineer interested in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Speech Analytics. I also work for [Loka](https://github.com/LokaHQ), doing extremely cool projects with the state-of-the-art in AI. 

Before my professional journey, I delved into the research world focusing on the integration of Transformers within an encoder-decoder architecture for remote sensing image captioning. [remote-sensing-image-captioning](https://github.com/Jbarata98/remote-sensing-image-captioning)

I enjoy discussing topics within the AI field, which is why I also dedicate my time to giving lectures at Data Science workshops and bootcamps hosted by [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/).
